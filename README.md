# Car Price Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing car price data that includes information such as the car's year, make, model, body type, condition, and mileage. The data is cleaned, explored using exploratory data analysis (EDA), and then used to build predictive models for car prices based on these factors. 

### Project Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various insights are drawn from the data, including visualizations and statistical summaries to understand trends and relationships between variables.
3. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Predictive models are built and evaluated to forecast car prices using different machine learning algorithms.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository_name.git
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Data Cleaning**: Use `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Run `02_eda_visualization.ipynb` to perform EDA, including generating visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Run `03_modeling_evaluation.ipynb` to build and evaluate predictive models for car price prediction.
